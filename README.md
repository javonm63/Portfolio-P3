🧭 Overview

WeTube.com is more than just a YouTube replica — it’s a kids-focused, all-in-one entertainment and learning platform built entirely on the frontend.

It combines music, gaming, videos, reading, and learning tools into one simple, engaging, and safe space designed specifically for children. With no signup required and no personal data collected, WeTube.com keeps kids’ online experiences safe, fun, and educational.

The best part? The platform’s design and ideas are inspired by my 6-year-old, making it genuinely tailored for young users.

🎯 Project Goal

The goal for this project was to:

Develop and deploy a production-ready frontend web application for kids (inspired by my daughter’s idea).

Solve the problem of kids needing multiple apps for learning, entertainment, and creativity.

Build a single-page application (SPA) that feels like a full-stack app by leveraging open-source APIs, local caching, and state management.

Design a kid-friendly UI and a fun, intuitive UX with colorful visuals and smooth navigation.

Set up CI/CD pipelines for automatic deployment and testing, allowing frequent updates and new content releases.
